					<h2>Laura's story</h2>
					<p>
						Laura grew up in the Sierra Nevada foothills of Northern California on a 10acre mini farm with her parents and six siblings. She was homeschooled much of her life and spent a great deal of her childhood in nature climbing trees, playing in creeks and venturing through tall grass meadows. Her childhood experiences instilled a deep love for the outdoors that continues to inspire her creativity in many mediums.  
						
						<br><br>Laura has an eclectic range of interests including song writing, painting, fire dancing, acting, cake decorating and photography. From an early age, she was drawn to poetry and began writing her own at age seven. By age 13 she taught herself to play guitar and started to write her own songs. As a teen she played in a band and managed the open mic at a local coffee shop where she gained inspiration from many artists.   
						
						<br><br>In 2011, after meeting her husband, Jesse, she gave birth to their daughter, Addie, and spent the first 4 years as a family in Santa Cruz, California, where she learned graphic design and cared for her daughter at home. Briefly, she worked as an independent actor in the bay area while pursuing her A.A. in liberal arts. After a 6-month journey around the country in 2018, Laura and her family re-located to the Olympic Peninsula of WA, where they still reside.

				<h1>Adventure</h1>
				<p>
					In 2018, after the loss of an important family member and her husbandâ€™s job of 15 years, Laura and her family decided to embark on an adventure around the western region of the United States, camping with their min-van for 6 months. On their trip they visited several State and National parks throughout California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, including some of Western Canada such as Vancouver Island and B.C., mainland. On their trip they endeavored to live as minimally as possible while instilling a strong reverence for nature and presence in their daughter, Addie. As they travelled, Laura homeschooled Addie and used their trip as an opportunity enrich her daily learning with hikes, maps, information centers and Jr. Ranger programs.
					<br><br>Laura and her husband, both hobby photographers, enjoyed shooting the many majestic views of peaks, valleys, ridges, oceans and water falls that they encountered along the way.
